On supported devices, Magisk Manager will download and customize a heavily obfuscated stub APK and use it as a replacement. The stub app will then download the full app into its private internal data, then dynamically load and run the actual full Magisk Manager.</p><p>Note, not all Android 9.0+ devices will be able to use this feature. To use an obfuscated stub as Magisk Manager, the Magisk daemon will have to rely on a special way to communicate with the app, and some OEMs (most likely Chinese manufacturers) block certain broadcasts, breaking the communication channel.</p><p>Magisk Manager will verify compatibility before it uses stubs to hide itself on Android 9.0+. <strong>The verification relies on Magisk v20.1+, which means you have to fully upgrade and reboot in order to opt in this feature.</strong> If you are already running a hidden Magisk Manager, <strong>restore and upgrade Magisk Manager, upgrade Magisk and reboot, then re-hide the app</strong>.</p><p>For those incompatible with the hiding-with-stub feature, there are also a few updates that everyone, regardless whether using stubs or not, can enjoy:</p><ul><li>You can now customize the app name of the repackaged Magisk Manager</li><li>Magisk Manager will generate new keys to sign the repackaged APK to prevent signature detection</li></ul><h3 id="full-changelog-here" tabindex="-1">Full Changelog: <a href="/MagiskChineseDocument/changes.html">here</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#full-changelog-here" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Full Changelog: [here](/changes.md)&quot;">​</a></h3>',9),o=[s];function r(l,d,h,g,c,u){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const f=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
